1. I evaluated the following primers:

__Pan-Pestivirus primers__

- _Pesti-11453-F_
- _Pesti-11607-R_

__Atypical porcine pestivirus primer and probe set__

- _APPV-NS5B-303F_
- _APPV-NS5B-385R_
- _APPV-NS5B-335-FAM_ (probe)

2. There were two databases used to test the primers were:
Pestivirus database (Obtained from ViPR)


Only sequences equal or larger than 200 nucleotides were evaluated.

3. [NCBI's e-PCR standalone application](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/epcr/) was used to evaluate the amplification of the primers __pairs__ vs. the databases. Primers and the real-time PCR probe were evaluated individually, and also as pairs.

4. Summary of results

### Pan-Pestivirus primers

Primer | Orientation | Number of hits with 0, 1, 2 or 3 mismatches | %coverage
-------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|----------
Pesti-11453-F | Forward | 1364 | 68.2%
Pesti-11607-R | Reverse | 971 | 48.55
